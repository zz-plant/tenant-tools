# Quick checks

## Safety and privacy
- Do not collect or display names, emails, phone numbers, or unit numbers.
- Evidence stays private by default; no public access to files.
- Avoid public write access and comment threads.

## Copy rules (ESL-first)
- Short, literal sentences.
- No idioms, sarcasm, threats, or legal claims.
- Use calm escalation phrasing (“next normal step”).

## Required validations
- Issue type from enum.
- Valid start date.
- Short free-text with length limits and sensitive-content warnings.

## PR and QA reminders
- Add tests for access control, evidence, notice generator, export, or public mode changes.
- Include a manual QA checklist in the PR summary.
- Add screenshots for visible UI changes.

# Copy review checklist

## ESL-first readability

- Sentences are short.
- Vocabulary is literal and simple.
- No idioms (example: “touch base”, “heads up”).
- No sarcasm or figurative language.

## Safety and legal framing

- No threats, insults, or accusation language.
- No wording that implies personalized legal advice.
- No instructions to break law or skip process safeguards.

## Privacy language

- Warnings remind users not to include names or identifying details.
- Copy does not ask for personal identity fields by default.

## Notice-template checks

Each template variant should include:

- what happened
- start date
- request for repair plan/timeline

And should avoid:

- intimidation language
- speculative claims
- criminal accusations

## Suggested substitutions

- Replace “escalate now” with “The next normal step is…”.
- Replace “make them pay” with “You can now send a follow-up request.”
- Replace “name and shame” with “Use the export summary for inspection or legal-aid process.”

# Building Ledger Copy Review

Use this skill when a change adds or edits user-facing copy, templates, labels, errors, or guidance text.

## 1) Required policy read

Read [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) first. Copy must follow ESL-first and safety rules.

## 2) Copy quality rules

- Use short, direct sentences.
- Avoid idioms, sarcasm, metaphor, or slang.
- Keep tone neutral and factual.
- Avoid legal threats or legal-advice wording.
- Prefer calm phrasing such as “The next normal step is…”.

## 3) Review process

1. List all changed user-facing strings.
2. Run checks from `references/copy-review-checklist.md`.
3. Rewrite any risky phrasing into neutral alternatives.
4. Confirm UI changes include screenshot evidence.

## 4) Output format for copy review

- **Status:** pass / needs changes
- **Copy findings:** bullets with exact text to change
- **Safer replacement:** one replacement per finding
- **Policy notes:** brief note if any privacy/safety language risk exists
